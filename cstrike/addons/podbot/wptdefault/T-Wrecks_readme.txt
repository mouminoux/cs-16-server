as_coast (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: Well-designed map by the Russian mapper FaN. The VIP starts at a 
blocked road and must make his way down to a house by the coast. A motor boat serves 
as the only escape point.
Waypoints notes: none

as_rising_sun (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map decription: Nice japanese setting; there are two escape zones, a tank and a 
helicopter. Some climbing, swimming and even diving can be required to escape.
Waypoint notes: There are some narrow ledges in this map. Under normal conditions 
they work 100%, but when engaged in combat, bots don't stick to waypoints, so in very 
few cases a bot might fall down. This is a general bot problem and could only be totally 
removed by not waypointing ledges at all. However, this would take away much of the 
fun.

cs_alps (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: Timbered framework houses in the mountains; a nice summer map with 
great music ;o).
Waypoint notes: none

cs_bigwong (waypointed by TAZ & T Wrecks)
Map description: A chinatown setting featuring excellent design and mult-level action. 
No sewers or vents to decrease speed, just a little maze of underpasses, tunnels, little 
courtyards etc. Besides, this map offers some rooftop action and sneaky camping spots 
on narrow ledges. Jumping skills recommended!
Waypoint notes: see as_rising_sun. I took TAZ's superb waypoints as a basis, added 
features, rewaypointed most areas and tweaked some problematic spots. Maybe the 
most difficult set of all the 20 maps I did...

cs_haste_final (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: A European city at night. Beautiful textures, good atmosphere and a 
nice mix of outdoor and indoor passages. The map looks bigger than it is and plays 
pretty fast. No boring sewer tunnels or long vents here...
Waypoint notes: I had to work a lot to get the bots up those ladders - they can only 
reach them if they jump just right. If you should still see a bot that needs two attempts to 
get up, remember that this can happen to human players as well...

cs_militia2k1 (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: A good militia remake; better design and some great layout changes. Now that stupid 
bathroom really makes sense because the house can be entered / left through it, for 
example.
Waypoint notes: none

cs_neighborhood (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: A clean and idyllic suburb. Well-kept gardens, freshly painted one-
family homes... and some fast action and great layout! If you don't know this map yet, 
get it!
Waypoint notes: none

cs_snowflake (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: A HUGE map that takes place in a little village in winter. Great winter 
atmosphere, long ways to the rescue zone and X-tender's mapping skills make this one 
a unique classic.
Waypoint notes: none

cs_storm (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: A little Arabic village located behind a ravine. There are dozens of 
ledges, balconys, rooftops etc. to climb and jump onto, as well as many possibilities for 
window-to-window combat. Almost every building can be entered! This map was bad to 
play with old PODBot, but thanks to the new pathfinder it's a whole new experience now!
Waypoint notes: In combat, one of the many jumps over the ravine might fail 
occasionally... see as_rising_sun for details.

cs_tibet (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: A little snow-covered village in the mountains. Multi-level combat, lots 
of rooftop action, climbing and jumping skills absolutely necessary!
Waypoint notes: none

cs_waterside (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: A house in the wilderness... extremely well designed and great to play. 
Very new map, designed for 1.6 and only suitable for faster computers!
Waypoint notes: none

cs_winternights (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: Christmas time! Warbeast's popular classic features a little café in a 
snow-covered village, short ways and loads of action!
Waypoint notes: Unfortunately, it's not possible to make bots get up that stack of wood 
near the CT spawn area to go through the tunnel. I tried every trick I know, but it just 
doesn't work. They can still jump up there after walking around the ledge between the 
rescue zones, but this is not very likely to happen. However, the terrorists will use the 
tunnel frequently to get behind the CTs' backs...

cs_wpndepot_01 (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: A great remake of the old cs classic.
Waypoint notes: Bots don't really know what to do with buttons (yet). It may sometimes 
take some time for them to open the garage doors, but eventually they will. It's a bot 
problem, and there's no way to get around it by waypointing differently.

de_celtic (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: A very well laid out defusion map with unique design.
Waypoint notes: Bots can plant the bomb on the tip of the big missile now - it wasn't 
easy to get them up there, but it was worth the trouble... ;o)

de_dawn (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: A de_dust spin-off. Fortunately, it adds a whole new passage to the 
map layout, providing much more variation!
Waypoint notes: none

de_heat (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: Another Arabic village. This one is a maze of balconys, ladders, sniper 
windows, underpasses... I have rarely seen maps that offer more possibilities.
Waypoint notes: none

de_karachi01 (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: A superb city map with hundreds of possible ways. Almost all rooftops 
and ledges can be reached - I hope you know how to jump. The bots sure do... ;o)
Waypoint notes: I'm really happy with this one...

de_museum (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: Who said archeology is boring? Blow some dinosaur skeletons to 
pieces in a well-designed museum... it's fun!
Waypoint notes: none

de_scud_2k1 (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: Surely you remember de_scud? A missile launcher located in a central 
courtyard, and a little control container in another courtyard at the edhge of the map? 
This is a cool remake and one of my favourites... it's fast, easy to learn and yet full of 
variation...
Waypoint notes: none

de_seaside2k (waypointed by >BKA< T Wrecks)
Map description: A village by the seaside, well designed and ideal for varied gameplay: no matter 
whether you are a sniper or a rusher, this map suits every need. Various strategies can 
lead to success here...
Waypoint notes: none
