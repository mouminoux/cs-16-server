It's an Italian family fued mafia-style over the ownership of a Restaurant. Funny story.
Waypoint notes: none

Waypoint notes: I got them to get all the way up on top of the Church...a 2 inch ledge.

de_iced (waypointed by SoUlFaThEr)

de_manila(v2) (waypointed by SoUlFaThEr)

de_sampa (waypointed by SoUlFaThEr)
Map description: A large downtown map...The bots, due to the new Pathfinder, use the whole map now!!!
Waypoint notes: none

de_simpsons (waypointed by SoUlFaThEr)
Map description: This is the best cartoon map. Whos going to make a Southpark map?
Waypoint notes: Because of the way some of the doors are made...a bot may get stuck on them...later versions of the bot might have this problem fixed.
also the teleport works most of the time, but in 4 hours of testing they got stuck on it twice.

de_stonepit (waypointed by SoUlFaThEr)
Map description: A remote warehouse it seems...very nice, otherwise I wouldn't have waypointed it right? hehe
Waypoint notes: This was the second horror trip of a waypoint next to bikini. but now all those vents and one rope ladder are navigated
well by the bots after long hours of testing trying to figure out how to get them to get off that darn ladder correctly at the CT start.
It's a very clean waypoint now :) 

de_tartarico (waypointed by SoUlFaThEr)
Map description: A simple map with  a nice layout.....one bomb spot is simply huge!!!
Waypoint notes: none

de_volare (waypointed by SoUlFaThEr)
Map description: Batmans best map to date imo.....outdoor park, lots of cliffs and waterfalls
Waypoint notes: none

fy_iceworld (waypointed by SoUlFaThEr)
Map description: I only did this map because of its popularity. I should kill RD for making this map that goes against the entire point of CS as a game.
Waypoint notes: They cut corners on this map really tight like they should

fy_pool_day (waypointed by SoUlFaThEr)
Map description: A small pool yard and it is the second most popular map in CS, by Squall
Waypoint notes: none

Enjoy the maps & waypoints.......this was 3 weeks of work for you and it pays off in playability :)
This stuff is surely my best work to date.
